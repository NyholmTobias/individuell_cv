                        <p className="text-left">After working with customer service for half a year i was asked to start working at the graphical department as a purchaser. My main task is to purchase printed items from an array of over 500 suppliers located all over the world and make sure that the orders come to us at the set date, with the right quantities and for the right price. This includes doing both strategical and operational purchasing, writing offers, ask for offers and to monitor deliveries. Apart from my regular assignments i got the chance to work with several differnt projects mostly to improve the workflow of the graphical department but also to help calculate and moderate the complaint costs of the whole company. I still work there on holidays or when there is less to do in school.</p>

I wanted to work more with projects and to get more logically challenging assignments. So i decided to chase one of my life time interests and started to study System Development. It's a broad education that touches most of the aspects of System Development. The main language has been C#, but we have gone over more (see skills section).</p>
