# My Resumé #

This project was made for a school assignment at NBI-/Handelsakademin, in the course called Web Applications. The assignment was to create you own resumé using a JavaScript framework. 

## Code design

The app is an SPA and index.js in the src folder uses components that are rendered in app.js. If the app runs in development mode the browser will update automatically everytime a file is saved.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cypress:open`

Opens cypress that lets you run tests on the app.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run depoly`

This app is hosted på github pages via bransch called gh-pages. The command npm run deploy is modified so it runs a build and then pushes the latest build to the gh-pages bransch.
